## About me 
Immediately after university, I opened a small business in the field of trade. After 2 years, I realized that I do not see myself in trading. I decided to become a front-end developer.
I love learning and discovering new things! I am able to multitask and quickly find solutions.

## Skills 
+ HTML5 
+ CSS3
+ JS (basics)
+ Git, Github

## Code Example
```
let a = 5;
let b = 7;

function sum(a, b) {
  sum = a + b;
  console.log(sum);
}

sum(a, b);
```
